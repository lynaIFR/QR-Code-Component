## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned through this project the positioning properties in CSS like: position relative/absolute, also the usage of margin/padding, in addition to how different elements of a website have their own CSS code to be fixed in place. Before and after working on this project i had a chance to practice on git commands and solve errors that i faced, one thing i learned is that when creating a repo on github i shouldn't create a README file and a master brach as this will cause a conflict error when pushing the files because git will also try to create the master branch.

### Continued development

While working on this project i struggled with positioning elements in the website trying to make it look good on different screen sizes, i may have managed to something acceptable but i'm sure there's a better way to do it and i'll keep learning and experiment on this subject.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://https://www.w3schools.com) - I mainly used this website as it gathers short and well explained tutorials with examples.
