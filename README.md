## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned through this project how to set a custom reset css code, also the positioning with flex properties in CSS. Before and after working on this project i had a chance to practice on git commands and solve errors that i faced.

### Continued development

While working on this project I struggled with positioning elements in the website trying to make it look good on different screen sizes, I may have managed to make something acceptable but I'm sure there's a better way to do it and I'll keep learning and experiment on this subject.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://https://www.w3schools.com) - I mainly used this website as it gathers short and well explained tops with examples.
- [resource 2](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - It helped with the css reset.
- [resource 3](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/center-a-div/) - Explains how to position elements with different methods.
